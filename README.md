# My Mobile Responsive Porfolio 
Homework 2

## Introduction

In today's day and age, technology can take on the form of a vast assortment of media devices and screen sizes. You can view pages on a computer screen monitor, a tablet, and even on a handheld phone. This means that web pages need to be designed to be adaptive and media responsive depending on the screen the page is being viewed on. A responsive design ensures that web applications will look excellent on a variety of devices, regardless of the size or type of media device. 

As a junior developer, I was tasked with creating a mobile-first application. I felt that this exercise will be beneficial, because there will be times when I will have to create an application that looks media ready first. Additionally, there could be times I will be tasked with adding a responsive design to an existing application. My motivation for doing this project was to test the skills I learned in class on Bootstrap CSS Framework. I also wanted to create a portfolio that is responsive so that I can showcase the projects I willd do for future job interviews.

## How I Created My Responsive Portfolio

I first started this assignment by making the containers for the Header and Navigation links. By utilizing what I learned about containers, I compared the sizing and column lengths to the images that were provided. I read over and referenced the Offical Bootstrap documentation and picked out what I liked. Once I found something I liked, I put it in my html file and tried to manipulate it to how I wanted it. Once I got the sizing how I wanted, I used what I learned on rows and columns and started tinkering around that. Once I got the header, I started adding place-holder content for the Bio-Image and Bio information. I then tackled the content page and referenced the Bootstrap documents to add a form. Once I figured out how to make the form and the form content, I moved onto the portfolio page. The portfolio page felt like the toughest part of this assignment. It took me a bit to figure out the containers and the text overlay but I finally settled on using Bootstrap cards. Creating the portfolio page really tested my knowledge on containers, rows, and columns. Once I got the portfolio page sorted out, I went back and used what I learned on the portfolio page to fix the layout of the header and main content on the Bio page and the contact page. I also have to ensure that each of the pages was responsive at each of the media screen sizes for a large, medium, small and extra small screen devices. One of the last things I worked on was the footer and making it a sticky footer. I feel that the knowledge and skills I learned while creating the other pages really helped me in getting the footer to come together.
