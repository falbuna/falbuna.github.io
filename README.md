# My Mobile Responsive Porfolio 
Homework 2

## Introduction

Today, technology can take on the form of a vast assortment of media devices and screen sizes. You can view pages on a computer screen monitor, a tablet, or even on a handheld phone. This means that web pages need to be designed to be adaptive and media responsive depending on the screen the page is being viewed on. A responsive design ensures that web applications will look excellent on a variety of devices and media screen sizes, regardless of the size or type of the media device. 

As a junior developer, I was tasked with creating a mobile-first application. I feel that will exercise will be beneficial, because there will be times when I will have to create an application that looks media ready first or will be tasked adding a responsive design to an existing application. My motivation for doing this project was to test the skills I learned in class on Bootstrap CSS Framework. I also wanted to create a portfolio that is responsive so that I can showcase the projects for future job interviews.
